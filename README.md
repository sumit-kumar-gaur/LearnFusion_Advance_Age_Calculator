Advanced Age Calculator is an HTML document with embedded JavaScript that calculates a user's age based on their date of birth and the current date. The form allows the user to input their date of birth, and then it calculates and displays their age in years, months, days, hours, and minutes, along with the number of days until their next birthday.
